# 🎯 08 – Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 4 (Programming Advices)

🎉 I’m thrilled to share that I’ve just completed the **08 – Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 4** course from [Programming Advices](https://programmingadvices.com/) in **Dr. Abu Hadhoud’s Roadmap**! 🏆

This marks a significant milestone in my coding journey! 🚀

In this fourth level of algorithm challenges, the problems became even more advanced, demanding sharp thinking, precision, and efficient code. I tackled **50+ complex problems** that tested not just logic, but also my ability to write clean, optimized, and reusable solutions.

## 💡 Highlights from this phase

- 🔷 Applying structured thinking to solve deeply layered problems.  
- 🔷 Writing **Date Functions** to enhance logic and thinking.  
- 🔷 Writing code with real-world constraints in mind — performance, readability, and edge cases.  
- 🔷 Sharpening debugging skills and developing the patience to keep improving until the code works just right.  
- 🔷 Getting more comfortable with abstraction and breaking big challenges into manageable parts.  
- 🔷 Completing **two hands-on projects** that solidified my learning and provided real-world code to showcase.

## 📚 What I Learned Before This Level
I completed the **Structured Programming** course — which laid the foundation for everything I’ve been building. That stage taught me how to think like a programmer: break problems down, organize logic, and build programs step by step.

## 🚀 What's Next?
🔜 I’m preparing to start **Foundations Level 2**. Then, I’ll dive into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — a major step I’m really looking forward to, as I know it will reshape how I approach software development.
